 ### Managing Costs
 <font size="1">
 
 | Key word      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
 |CapEx (Capital expenses) |CapEx is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment (money spent to BUY infrastructure). Ie. Upfront costs. </br> e.g deploying your own data center with physical servers, purchasing Zaure Reserved VM instances, lease software</br> Advantages: predictable fixed costs </Br>Disadvantages: Value decreases over time, waster resource when the project is over, additional cost to maintain infrastructure with time, you might need a tema to manage the infrastructure.     |
 |OpEx (Operational Expenditure|Money spend to USE a service or product. zero upfront costs, Cloud computing shifts IT spending to a pay-as-you-go model, like utility billing; you only pay for what you use, when you use it. For startups or new applications, this well-established argument is sound.</br> e.g. Provisioning VMs as you need them, using Azure Funtions and paying for invocations.</br>Advantages: test before committing, great for agile environments where demand is unpredictable, ability to delete the resource when the task is done.|
 |Consumption-based Model|you are billed for only what you use. e.g Azure functions - you pay for number of invocations!|
 |Fixed price|you are billed for instances (for its lifetime) irrespective of whether they are used or not. e.g. You provision a VM instance, any App service plan|
 |TCO (Total cost of ownership) calculator| Estimate cost savings you get by migrating your workloads to Azure|
 |Steps of TCO|<ol><li>Define your workloads: Enter the details of your on-premises workloads. servers, databases, storage, networking details</li><li>Adjust assumptions: customize electricity costs, storage costs, IT labour costs, Hardware costs, software costs etc</li><li>view report: side by side comparison of the cost breakdown</li></ol>|
 |Pricing calculator|estimate the costs for Azure services. e.g: VM,storage accounts, Azure SQL database, App service, Azure Cismos DB, AKS. ideal place to explore nd learn important factors about different services. google pricing calculator |
 |Factors that affect cost|<table><tr><th>Factor</th><th>Details</th></tr><tr><td>Resource type and configuration</td><td>How much memory? How much CPU?

 |Azure Cost management|<li>Set up and manage your account- configure subscriptions, manage invoices and payment methods. Can create a budget. <li>Analyze and optimize cloud costs- break down and analyze costs for deeper undrstanding of cost and usage patterns <li>Control and optimise costs. set up budget, can give budget a name, set up cost alerts at different thresholds |
 |Cost management best practices|<li> Estimate costs before you deploy IPricing Calculator) <li> Migration cost (TCO) <Li> Create Group resources based on cost ownership- Subscriptions, Resource Groups, attach a cost Tags for each resource you create <li>Use Cost Management feature - cost analysis, Budget and cost alerts, advisor recommendations<li> stop resources when you don't need them (remember you pay all active resources), Use Managed Services PaaS >>> IaaS <li>Reserve VMs for 1 or 3 years|
