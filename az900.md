### Benefits and Considerations of Using Cloud Services
<font size="1">
 
 | Key word     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|High Availability (HA)|<li>Systems are available for long time <li>High availability is a quality of computing infrastructure that allows it to continue functioning, even when some of its components fail. ... Highly available systems guarantee a certain percentage of uptime—for example, a system that has 99.9% uptime will be down only 0.1% of the time—0.365 days or 8.76 hours per year. **What HA is not** – Backup or DR, High performance, Load balancing|
|Scalability|Cloud scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand.One of the great features of Azure service is its ability to auto scale according to the demands of the application usage. ... Basically, increasing or decreasing the resources for application is called scaling. Instance is created each time a web app is deployed <li>Scale up – Increase workload on current resources<li>Scale down – decrease workload on the current resources |
|Elasticity|scaling out - Elasticity is used just to meet the sudden up and down in the workload for a small period of time. Scalability is used to meet the static increase in the workload whereas elasticity is used to meet dynamic changes, where the resources need can increase or decrease. Increase or remove  workload on additional resources.|
|Agility|how quickly the resources respond the changes. Agility is the ability to move quickly and easily in response to change or challenge, but in a business setting, the term really depends on the context. e.g.: Provision or decommission cloud services in matter using self-service|
|DR|The ability to recover from a failure. Disaster recovery is built in. How Azure Site Recovery and Backup Will Help You Build a Reliable Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Strategy. Among the challenges facing your business is ensuring that your data is safe and recoverable, and that your apps and workloads are running in the event of a planned or unplanned outage.|

 ### Managing Costs
 <font size="1">
 
 | Key word      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
 |CapEx (Capital expenses) |CapEx is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment (money spent to BUY infrastructure). Ie. Upfront costs. </br> e.g deploying your own data center with physical servers, purchasing Zaure Reserved VM instances, lease software</br> Advantages: predictable fixed costs </Br>Disadvantages: Value decreases over time, waster resource when the project is over, additional cost to maintain infrastructure with time, you might need a tema to manage the infrastructure.     |
 |OpEx (Operational Expenditure|Money spend to USE a service or product. zero upfront costs, Cloud computing shifts IT spending to a pay-as-you-go model, like utility billing; you only pay for what you use, when you use it. For startups or new applications, this well-established argument is sound.</br> e.g. Provisioning VMs as you need them, using Azure Funtions and paying for invocations.</br>Advantages: test before committing, great for agile environments where demand is unpredictable, ability to delete the resource when the task is done.|
 |Consumption-based Model|you are billed for only what you use. e.g Azure functions - you pay for number of invocations!|
 |Fixed price|you are billed for instances (for its lifetime) irrespective of whether they are used or not. e.g. You provision a VM instance, any App service plan|
 |TCO (Total cost of ownership) calculator| Estimate cost savings you get by migrating your workloads to Azure|
 |Steps of TCO|<ol><li>Define your workloads: Enter the details of your on-premises workloads. servers, databases, storage, networking details</li><li>Adjust assumptions: customize electricity costs, storage costs, IT labour costs, Hardware costs, software costs etc</li><li>view report: side by side comparison of the cost breakdown</li></ol>|
 |Pricing calculator|estimate the costs for Azure services. e.g: VM,storage accounts, Azure SQL database, App service, Azure Cismos DB, AKS. ideal place to explore nd learn important factors about different services. google pricing calculator |

 |Azure Cost management|<li>Set up and manage your account- configure subscriptions, manage invoices and payment methods. Can create a budget. <li>Analyze and optimize cloud costs- break down and analyze costs for deeper undrstanding of cost and usage patterns <li>Control and optimise costs. set up budget, can give budget a name, set up cost alerts at different thresholds |
 |Cost management best practices|<li> Estimate costs before you deploy IPricing Calculator) <li> Migration cost (TCO) <Li> Create Group resources based on cost ownership- Subscriptions, Resource Groups, attach a cost Tags for each resource you create <li>Use Cost Management feature - cost analysis, Budget and cost alerts, advisor recommendations<li> stop resources when you don't need them (remember you pay all active resources), Use Managed Services PaaS >>> IaaS <li>Reserve VMs for 1 or 3 years|
