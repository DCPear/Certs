### Benefits and Considerations of Using Cloud Services
<font size="1">
 
 | Key word     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|High Availability (HA)|<li>Systems are available for long time <li>High availability is a quality of computing infrastructure that allows it to continue functioning, even when some of its components fail. ... Highly available systems guarantee a certain percentage of uptime—for example, a system that has 99.9% uptime will be down only 0.1% of the time—0.365 days or 8.76 hours per year. **What HA is not** – Backup or DR, High performance, Load balancing|
|Scalability|Cloud scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand.One of the great features of Azure service is its ability to auto scale according to the demands of the application usage. ... Basically, increasing or decreasing the resources for application is called scaling. Instance is created each time a web app is deployed <li>Scale up – Increase workload on current resources<li>Scale down – decrease workload on the current resources |
|Elasticity|scaling out - Elasticity is used just to meet the sudden up and down in the workload for a small period of time. Scalability is used to meet the static increase in the workload whereas elasticity is used to meet dynamic changes, where the resources need can increase or decrease. Increase or remove  workload on additional resources.|
|Agility|how quickly the resources respond the changes. Agility is the ability to move quickly and easily in response to change or challenge, but in a business setting, the term really depends on the context. e.g.: Provision or decommission cloud services in matter using self-service|
|DR|The ability to recover from a failure. Disaster recovery is built in. How Azure Site Recovery and Backup Will Help You Build a Reliable Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Strategy. Among the challenges facing your business is ensuring that your data is safe and recoverable, and that your apps and workloads are running in the event of a planned or unplanned outage.|

</font> 

### Regions and Zones
 <font size="1">

 | Key word     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Geographies|<li>Azure is broken down into worldwide geographies, which ensures data residency and compliance boundaries are met. Each geography will contain two or more regions. <li>An Azure geography is a discrete market, typically containing at least two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries. Geographies allow customers with specific data-residency and compliance needs to keep their data and applications close.<li>Customer can select whether data is stored. It doesn’t have to be within their own geography.|
|Regions and region pairs|<li>Azure provides +60 regions around the world (most number of regions around the world)<li>A region is simply a collection of data centers<li>One thing to note is not all services are available in all regions.<li>Each of the regions contains the regional pairs. A regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography.<li>Azure serializes platform updates (planned maintenance) across regional pairs, ensuring that only one region in each pair updates at a time. If an outage affects multiple regions, at least <li>one region in each pair will be prioritized for recovery <li>Some Azure services take further advantage of paired regions to ensure business continuity and to protect against data loss. Azure provides several storage solutions that take advantage of paired regions to ensure data availability.
|Availaibilty zones|Unique physical locations within a region. <li>Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, connectivity and networking.<li>Not all locations have availability zones. <li>There are 3 zones per region.<li> Azs in a region are connected through low-latency links|
|Availibility sets|When you implement availability zones you protect against data center failures. And this is an optional service, you do not have to implement it. Before availability zones we would protect our data using availability sets. Availability sets are still available to us and we still use them. And availability set ensures that our virtual machine is online during maintenance or failure. When you provision a virtual machine to an availability set the virtual machine is assigned to an update domain and a fault domain. The reason the virtual machine is assigned to the update domain is that only one update to main would be updated at a time. Ensuring that your virtual machine is still up and running in another update domain. Assigning the virtual machine to a fault domain provides physical isolation within the data center. That's it for the physical components that make up the Azure Architecture. |
|Fault domains|Group of VMs sharing a common power source and a network switch|
|Update domains|Groupof VMs that are rebooted (updated at the same time)|

|Cloud Init Script- automate the previous step|when creating a VM, add this scipt to custom data and cloud init section. the script will automatically run<pre>#!/bin/sh </br>sudo su</br>apt-get -y update</br>apt-get -y install nginx<pre>echo "Welcome to Azure $(hostname)" > /var/www/html/index.html</pre>|
| Increasing Availability for Azure VMs - Availability Sets and Zones|<li>Single instance VM (premium SSD and ultra disk: 99.9%, standard SSD managed Disks: 99.5%, Standard HDD Managed disks: 95%) <li> Create two or more instances in the same avaialbility set - 99.95% <li>Two or more istances in two or more availibilty zones in the same Azure region:99.99% <li> Summary: create multiple instances in multiple AZs if you want high availability|
|VM Scale sets| How do you simplify creation and management of  multiple VMs? VM scale sets<li> allow you to create and manage a group og Azure VMs (HA)<li> add a load balancer (optional)Add a load balancer <li>(optional) Distribute VM instances across Multiple AZs (where avaialble) <li> Supports Manual Scaling and Auto Scaling <li>Supports up to 1000 VM instances in a singlr sales sets|
|Create a VM scale set|<li> search for Virtual machine scale set <li>Add <li> resource group, name, default region, availability zones, image, size, SSH public key (can choose an already exisitng one)<li>network interface - add a public ip as by default it only creates a private ip address <pre> Edit network interface, go to public inbound port -allow selected ports </br> tick HTTP(80) , SSH(22) - public IP address -> Enabled </pre> <li> Use a load balancer, accept all the defaults <li> scaling options manual/custom <li>Advanced - run cloud init scripts here and specify fault default count <li> "instances" will show the instaces created <li>individul invoke- Open each instances and find the public ip addresses to run <li> run via load balancer - open and find the ip address to run (if you do a curl 'ip address' in bash, it will show how load balancer balance requests between VMs )<li> can increase the number of instances via "scaling"|
|Load balances |</sub><sub>Typically have front end and a back end</sub><sub><sup>  public ip address is the front end. Requests received to the frontend are routed to the backend. Backend pools are the scale set. </sup></sub>|
|public Ip address| are not free. charged per hour. also it can get lost if you restart the machine.|
|static ip address| if you want to keep the same ip address, you can specify a static ip address when you create the VM. <li> public ip -> create new -> assigment static|
|Azure monitoring| Monitoring for your Azure VMs|
|Dedicated Hosts|Physical servers dedicated to one customer- not sharing , go to Martket place and select dedicated host to create. all the VMs created on this host will be guranteed to be belonging to you only|
|Create cheaper, temporary instances for non critical workloads| Create a spot instance <li> tick Azure spot instance option while creating the VM. Azure offers unused space at a cheaper prices. important no availability guarantee. Azure can evct spot Vms with 30 sec notice|
|ReserveD VMs| search for reservations. add. reserving for 1 or 3 years for significal cost discounts|
|Vertical Scaling| increasing hardware from small to large.i.e. deploying application/database to a bigger instance. <li> larger hard drive, a faster CPU, more RAM, CPU,I/O, or networking capabilities etc. <li> Virtual Machines -> settings-> Size <li> there are limits to vertical scaling, also can be very expensive| 
|Horizontal scaling|Delpoying multiple instance of a application/database </br> Horizontal Scaling is preferred to Vertical Scaling <br> Horizontal scaling increases availability <br> BUT Horizontal Scaling needs addtional infrastructure: Scaling Sets, Load Balancers etc.|
|Site recovery|Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to secondary location, and access apps from there. <br> your virtual machine -> site-> Disaster recovery -> choose tartget region -> replicate|

|IAAS|Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a cloud computing offering in which a vendor provides users access to computing resources such as servers, storage and networking. Organizations use their own platforms and applications within a service provider's infrastructure. i.e Use only ifrastucture from cloud computer </br>Only pay for what you use </br> **Responsibilities:** </br>Service provider – responsible for the infrastructure. i.e Virtualization, Physical hardware and networking </br>Customer – Operating systems, configuration and load balancing, Application code and runtime, auto scaling, OS upgrades and patches, backups, availability and so on.</br> e.g Azure VM|
|PAAS|Cloud platform services, also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications.Prebuilt services provided by the service provider.</br> **Responsibilities:** </br> Service provider- is responsible for infrastructure, operating systems (including patches and upgrades),Application Runtime,   management-auto Scaling, Availablity & Load blancing etc.., and backups </br> Customer-Configuration(of Application and Services), Application code </br> e.g Azure App service </br> Databases - Relational & NoSQL (Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Databases etc </br> Queues, AI, ML,Operations etc!)|
|(PAAS)Azure App Service|Fully managed platform for building, deploying and scaling your web apps. also supports REST APIs and mobilr back ends. </br> Natively supports .NET, .NET Core, Node.js, Java Python and PHP|
|(PAAS)Azure App service plan|  Choose App Service Plan: defines a set of compute resources for a web app </br> **Features:** Automated Deployment and management <li>Auto Scaling<li>Built in Load Balancing |
|(PAAS)Create App service|<li> Search App Services <li> create - create Web App, subscription, unique name, code/docker container, Operating system(linux/windows), app service plan - review and create</br> open up and running app service, copy URL to access via browser, scale up and out options |
|(PAAS)microservices|trend is to build small focused microservices </br> Flexibility to innovate and build application in a different programming languages (Go, Java, Python or JavaScript..etc </br> but deplyment become complex! </br> Containers provide a way of deploying Go, Java, Python or JavaScript microservices|
|(PAAS)Containers|Create a docker image for each microservice </br> A Docker image contains application code, libraries, tools, application run time, dependencies and other files needed to make an application run. </br> VM virtulaizes hardware, while containers virtulaize OS </br> runs the same way on any infrastructure- your local machine, Corporate data center, Cloud </br> **Advantages:** <li>Docker containers are light weight (compared to vitual machines as they do not have a Guest OS) <li> Docker provides isolation for containers <l> Docker is cloud neutral|
|(PAAS)Azure container instances (CaaS)|<li> Manage and run simple container based applications <li>**You DO NOT** need to provision and manage VMs <li> Start containers in seconds <li>Azure App service also supports deploying simple containers|
|(PAAS)Create a container instance|search container instances, create, resouce group, unique container name, quickstart images, defaults for image & size, review and create|
|(PAAS)Container Orchestration| Just having a container is not sufficient, it needs orchestration </br> Typical features: <li> Auto Scaling: Scale containers based on demand <li> Service discovery - help microservices find one another <li>Load balancer- Distribute load among multiple instances of a microservice <li> Self Healing- Do health checks and replace failing instances <li> Zeor downtime deploymewnts- release new versions without downtime </br> Kubenetes is the most popular </br> EKS (Elastic Kubenetes Service) -AWS </br> AKS (Azure Kubenetes service ) </br> GKE (Google Kubenetes Engine)|

|(PAAS)Serverless|Serverless computing is an architecture where code execution is fully managed by a cloud provider, instead of the traditional method of developing applications and deploying them on servers. It means developers don't have to worry about managing, provisioning and maintaining servers when deploying code. </br>Serverless computing allows developers to build apps without worrying about the underlying resources, such as virtual machines and networks. The cloud provider is responsible for provisioning, scaling and managing the infrastructure that is required. Apps built on serverless compute can scale dynamically in seconds, and it's a much faster time to market because the infrastructure is already being managed.</br> **Serverless does NOT mean "No servers". ZERO visibility into infrastructure </br> Flexiblr scaling and automated high availability </br> Most Important: Pay for use(pay for requests and NOT servers) ZERO REQUESTS => ZERO COST <br> e.g Azure functions, AWS Lambdas, Google functions |
|(PAAS)Azure functions (FaaS)|(tied to  App service)Azure Function runs a small piece of code instead of the full blown app.</br>Azure Functions are event, timer, message, or triggered by another event.</br>Basically something will trigger an Azure Function. Typical usage scenarios for Azure Functions include IoT or the processing of data.</br>For example, if someone uploads an image, then the Azure Function would be triggered to process that image.<li> you don't worry about servers or scaling or availability<li> You only worry about your code <li> You pay for what you use - Number of requests, duration of requests, memory consumed <li>Supports C#, Python, JavaScript, Typescript and Java|
|(PAAS)create an Azure functions|Serach for function app, Create Function App, resource group, unique function app name, runtime stack e.g Node.js , create </br> open resource, add a function, code + test, <li>test/run the template code <li> or get function URL, run via browser |
|(PAAS)Logic Apps|Logic apps automate tasks, processes, et cetera, for integration with other services like apps, data, systems and services.</br>No code is required when we use a logic app.</br>We typically use logic apps to integrate with cloud and or on-premises solutions. <li> Recommended for orchestrating long-running processes and workflows <li> low-code/no-code solutuion <li> Link triggers to action|
|(PAAS)Create a logic app |search for logic apps, add consumption,resource groups, logic app name, default for rest and review and create <li> by default it would take you to logic app designer |
|SAAS|Centrally hosted software (mostly on the cloud). </br> Offered on a subscription basis (pay-as-you-go) </br> e.g email, calendering & office tools, CRM, ERP and document management tools </br> **Responsibilities:**</br> Service provider- is responsible for </li> OS (incl. upgrades and patches) <li> Application Runtime <li>Auto scaling, Availability & Load balancing etc..<li>Application code and/or, Application configuration (How much memory? How Many instances?.. </br> Customer is responsible for <li> configuring software|

### Azure Storage
 <font size="1">

 | Key word     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Storage types|Block, File, object|
|Block storage|The type of storage on your hard disks. Single block storage can be attached to one VM only. one VM can be attached to multiple block storage|
|file Storage| can be shared between multiple VMs|
|Object storage|Allow upload/download objects using a REST API without mounting them onto your VM|
|Azure Storage|  Azure storage is used to store files, messages and tables.It is massively scalable (upto few PetaBytes), is durable and highly available as well as incredibly secure.|
|Data types|Azure supports 3 types of data <ol><li> Structured data -typical usage of structured data - Has a schema,Rigid format,Relational data,Uses keys to relate a row un one table to a row in another table <li>Semi-structured data - Typical usage: tab delimited files, CSV, XML, and JSON - Adhoc schema, Non-relational format, Known as NoSQl data,Uses tags for data location<li>Unstructured Data- typical usage PDFs, DOCs, JPGs, AVI -No Schema or data Structure|
|Azure Core storage services|There are 5 Storage services available to us in Azure. <li>Azure Blobs - Object store for text and binary data <li>Azure Disk - Block storage (hard disks) for Azure VMs <li> Azure Files- File shares for cloud and on-prem <li>Azure Tables - NoSQL store (This is very basic. Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is prefered) <li> Azure Queue - Decouple applications using messaging </br>(for fundamental exam focus is on Blob, Disk & File)</br> Azure Storage account is needed for Azure files, Azure Blobs, Azure Queues and Azure Tables|
|Azure Storage </br> Data redundancy|<table><tr><th>Option</th><th>Redundancy</th></tr><tr><td>Locally redundant</br> storage (LRS)</td><td>Three synchornous copies in the same data center. </br> Lease expensive and least availability </br>**Non critical data**</td></tr><tr><td>Zone-redundant </br> storage (ZRS)</td><td>Three synchornous copies in the AZs in the primary region.</br>**Higher availablity**</td></tr><tr><td>Geo-redundant </br> storage (GRS)</td><td>LRS + Asynchornous copy to secondary region(3 more copies using LRS)</br>**in conjunction with backup**</td></tr></tr><tr><td>Geo-zone-redundant </br> storage (GZRS)</td><td>ZRS + Asynchornous copy to secondary region(3 more copies using LRS)</br>Most expensive and highest available. </br>**Critical data**</td></tr></table>|
|Azure Disk Storage|Disks for Azure VMs <li>Standard HDD: Recommended for Backup, non-critical, infrequent access <li> Standard SSD: Recommended for Web servers, lightly used enterprise applications and dev/test environments<li> Premium SSD disks: Recommended for production and performace sensitive workloads <li>Ultra disks SSD: Recommendede for IO-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases (for example, SQL, Oracle), and other transaction-heavy workloads  </br> Premium and Ultra provide very high availability|
|Managed vs Unmanaged Disks|<li>Managed Disks are easy to use: Azure handles storage, High fault tolerance and availability <li> Unmanaged Disks are old and tricky (avoid them if you can) - You need to manage storage and storage account, Disks stored in containers (not docker containers)|
|File Storage|Azure Files <li>Media workflows need huge shared  storage for things like video editing <li> Enterprise users need a quick way to share files in a secure & organized way <li> Azure Files are managed file shares <li>Connect from multiple devices concurrently <ul><li>From cloud or on-premises <li>From different OS:Windows, Linux, and macOS</ul><li>Supoorts Server Message Block (SMB) and Network file System (NFS) protocols <li>Usecase: Shared files between multiple VMs (example: configuration files) |
|How to build out Azure file storage |(exactly the way how we build out our file structure on our desktops and laptops.) </br>Storage account</br>Create shares</br> Create directories</br>Store files </br> ![alt text](file_storage_example.jpg)|
|How to set up Azure Files|1. &nbsp; create storage account- resource group, storage account name, region, performance, redundancy, default for Advanced, default for Networking, default for Data protection, default for tags </br> 2.&nbsp; in the storage account, add a file share-> name-> Qutoa-> Tiers default-> create - once created you can connect to different devices |
|Azure blob storage </br>**Binary Large Object**t|<li> Objects storage in Azure <li> Structure: Storage Account >Container(s)>Blob(s)<li> Store massive volumes of unstructured data - store all file types </br> Text, binary, backup & archives<ul><li> Media files and archives, Application packages and logs <li>Backups of your databases or storage devices </ul> There are three types of Blobs <li> Block blobs- Store text or binary as a whole (a new file will replace the old)<li>Append Blobs - Store log files (append operations)<li> Page Blobs-Page blobs are a collection of 512-byte pages, which provide the ability to read/write arbitrary ranges of bytes. Hence, page blobs are ideal for storing index-based and sparse data structures like OS and data disks for Virtual Machines and Databases.|
|Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2|Azure blob storage flat, non hierarchical) enhanced <li>Designed for enterprise big data analytics (exabytes, hierarchical) <li> Low-cost, tiered storage, with high availability/disaster recovery|
|Different kinds of data can be stored in Blob Storage|<li>Media files,website static content <li>Backups of your databases or storage devices<li> Long term archives|
|Variations in access patterns </br>**Azure blob storage access tiers**|<li>Azure storage offers different access tiers, allowing you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. Available access tiers include: </br>**Hot** - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.The hot tier has a highest storage costs but the lowest access costs. The hot tier is the default tier when you create a new storage account. </br>**Cool** - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 dayssuch as short-term backups or data that would still need to be accessed immediately.</br>**Archive** -This is where we store data that is required infrequently such as long-term backups or data that is older than 180 days. Microsoft does recommend that data that is archived must be archived for at least 180 days. If you access that data before the 180 days, you could be charged an additional fee. Archive data is stored offline which means it has a high retrieval latency. It could take several hours or even days to retrieve data from the archive tier but it does offer the lowest storage costs but the highest access cost. We can use these tiers to create a Blob storage lifecycle starting off with our hot data that's accessed all the time. If data hasn't been accessed in let's say 40 days, it gets moved to the cool tier. If that data then hasn't been accessed for six months, it gets moved to the archive tier. If that data hasn't been accessed in a year, then it can be automatically deleted. </br> To access: Rehydrate(Change access tier to hot or cool)OR copy to another blob with access tier hot or cool. ![alt text](blob_Storage_Lifecycle.jpg)</br>**Storage tiers can only be configured in Blob storage** </br> youcan change **access tiers** of an object at any point at time|
|create a blob storage| create a container, upload a file and also change tier can be done, container "properties" URL can be used to upload/download</br>Shared access signature can be used provide restricted access for a specific time frame to Azure container|

 ### Managing Costs
 <font size="1">
 
 | Key word      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
 |CapEx (Capital expenses) |CapEx is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment (money spent to BUY infrastructure). Ie. Upfront costs. </br> e.g deploying your own data center with physical servers, purchasing Zaure Reserved VM instances, lease software</br> Advantages: predictable fixed costs </Br>Disadvantages: Value decreases over time, waster resource when the project is over, additional cost to maintain infrastructure with time, you might need a tema to manage the infrastructure.     |
 |OpEx (Operational Expenditure|Money spend to USE a service or product. zero upfront costs, Cloud computing shifts IT spending to a pay-as-you-go model, like utility billing; you only pay for what you use, when you use it. For startups or new applications, this well-established argument is sound.</br> e.g. Provisioning VMs as you need them, using Azure Funtions and paying for invocations.</br>Advantages: test before committing, great for agile environments where demand is unpredictable, ability to delete the resource when the task is done.|
 |Consumption-based Model|you are billed for only what you use. e.g Azure functions - you pay for number of invocations!|
 |Fixed price|you are billed for instances (for its lifetime) irrespective of whether they are used or not. e.g. You provision a VM instance, any App service plan|
 |TCO (Total cost of ownership) calculator| Estimate cost savings you get by migrating your workloads to Azure|
 |Steps of TCO|<ol><li>Define your workloads: Enter the details of your on-premises workloads. servers, databases, storage, networking details</li><li>Adjust assumptions: customize electricity costs, storage costs, IT labour costs, Hardware costs, software costs etc</li><li>view report: side by side comparison of the cost breakdown</li></ol>|
