|Azure inititives| Group of policies. Azure provides some predefined initiatives. view them under Policy->authoring->definitions|
|Compliance dashboard|Aggregated view of the overall compliance with options to drill down to specific resource/policy|
|Azure policy examples|<ul><li>Only allow creation of VMs of specific sizes</li><li>Only allow creation of resources in a specific region</li><li>Automatically tag all resources in a resource group with the same tags as that of the resource group</li><li>MFA should be mandatory for certain types of accounts </li><li>Exisitng non-compliant resources will be marked as non-compliant, but they will continue to work as is</li><li>policy evaluation is NOT immediate, run once every hour approx</li><ul>|
|Azure Blue prints|Just haveing rules is not suffcient. Azure Blueprint=One or more of (Policy + Role + ARM template + Resource Group) configurations. Azure provides number of pre defined blueprints. Also architecture team can create Blueprints to orginizations standards, patterns, and requirements and the team can use the blueprint to create resources. BP can be assigned to indivdual subscriptions and BPs can be used to set up resource groups within subscriptions|
|why blueprints| Helps teams to quickly set up environemnts adhering to organizational standards. you can even setup an automated CI/CD pipeline. |
|Resource locks|Prevent accidental deletion/modification of resources, applicable at multiple levels: subscription, resource group or resource. Azure resource inherits locks from its resource group and subscriptions.  Locked resources should be unlocked before it can be changed.| two options CanNotDelete (authorized users can read and modify but cannot delete)  and ReadOnly (authorized users can read but cannot delete/update). A resource can have multiple read or delete locks.

 ### Managing Costs
 <font size="1">
 
 | Key word      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
 |CapEx (Capital expenses) |CapEx is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment (money spent to BUY infrastructure). Ie. Upfront costs. </br> e.g deploying your own data center with physical servers, purchasing Zaure Reserved VM instances, lease software</br> Advantages: predictable fixed costs </Br>Disadvantages: Value decreases over time, waster resource when the project is over, additional cost to maintain infrastructure with time, you might need a tema to manage the infrastructure.     |
 |OpEx (Operational Expenditure|Money spend to USE a service or product. zero upfront costs, Cloud computing shifts IT spending to a pay-as-you-go model, like utility billing; you only pay for what you use, when you use it. For startups or new applications, this well-established argument is sound.</br> e.g. Provisioning VMs as you need them, using Azure Funtions and paying for invocations.</br>Advantages: test before committing, great for agile environments where demand is unpredictable, ability to delete the resource when the task is done.|
 |Consumption-based Model|you are billed for only what you use. e.g Azure functions - you pay for number of invocations!|
 |Fixed price|you are billed for instances (for its lifetime) irrespective of whether they are used or not. e.g. You provision a VM instance, any App service plan|
 |TCO (Total cost of ownership) calculator| Estimate cost savings you get by migrating your workloads to Azure|
 |Steps of TCO|<ol><li>Define your workloads: Enter the details of your on-premises workloads. servers, databases, storage, networking details</li><li>Adjust assumptions: customize electricity costs, storage costs, IT labour costs, Hardware costs, software costs etc</li><li>view report: side by side comparison of the cost breakdown</li></ol>|
 |Pricing calculator|estimate the costs for Azure services. e.g: VM,storage accounts, Azure SQL database, App service, Azure Cismos DB, AKS. ideal place to explore nd learn important factors about different services. google pricing calculator |
 |Factors that affect cost|<table><tr><th>Factor</th><th>Details</th></tr><tr><td>Resource type and configuration</td><td>How much memory? How much CPU? Which access tier? </td></tr><tr><td>Usage meters</td><td>How long was your VM running for? How much ingress and How much egress? How many invocations of an Azure function?</td></tr><tr><td>Azure subscription type</td><td>Free trial vs Pay as you go vs Enterprise Agreement</td></tr><tr><td>Azure Marketplace</td><td>Vendors decide pricing on Azure Marketplace</td></tr><tr><td>Which Region</td><td>Price varies from Region to Region</td></tr><tr><td>Data transfer</td><td><li>Ingress and Egress <li>inbound data from on-prem to Azure is free <li>outbound data from Azure to On-prem is NOT free <li> Data traffic between Azure Services in the same region/AZ is free </td></tr><tr><td>Reserved or not</td><td>some service s offer reservation ahead of time </td></tr></table>|
 |Azure Cost management|<li>Set up and manage your account- configure subscriptions, manage invoices and payment methods. Can create a budget. <li>Analyze and optimize cloud costs- break down and analyze costs for deeper undrstanding of cost and usage patterns <li>Control and optimise costs. set up budget, can give budget a name, set up cost alerts at different thresholds |
 |Cost management best practices|<li> Estimate costs before you deploy IPricing Calculator) <li> Migration cost (TCO) <Li> Create Group resources based on cost ownership- Subscriptions, Resource Groups, attach a cost Tags for each resource you create <li>Use Cost Management feature - cost analysis, Budget and cost alerts, advisor recommendations<li> stop resources when you don't need them (remember you pay all active resources), Use Managed Services PaaS >>> IaaS <li>Reserve VMs for 1 or 3 years|

 | Key word      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
|Tags| Identify applications, environments or business units that a specific resource is asscociated with. Adding Tags is free. </br> <li> **Report and track costs** for a group of resources by assigning them witht the same tag <li> **Group resources** based on their SLA, security or compliance requirements </br> Best Practice: identify mandatory tags that all resources should have and enforce it using Azure policy </br> <li> e.g. Environement, BusinessUnit, Priority </Br> Tags for Resources are **NOT** inherited by default from their resource group.| 
|Windows virtual desktop|desktops to remote developers. </br> connect with any device over the internet</br>centralized security with Azure AD </br> Option to Bring your own licenses (BYOL)|
|Marketplace|when the service is not directly available.<li>Discover, try and deploy the cloud software you want <li> customised and cetified solutions, e2e solutions,solutions for compute, containers, databases, developer tools, devOps<li> e.g Wordpress, RabbitMW, CouchDB etc <li> Flexible hourly billing|
